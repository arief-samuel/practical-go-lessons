## Chapter 10 functions
### Keyword to take

- Vocabulary
    - When we create a function, we say that we define it.
    - The input values are the function parameters.
    - The output values are the function results.
    - When we use a function, we say that we call it.
    - A function usage is called a function call.

    - Declaring a variable makes sense when you need to store the functionâ€™s result to use it at another location in your program.
